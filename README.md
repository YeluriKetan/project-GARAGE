# Project GARAGE

**GARAGE** stand for **G**raph **A**ugmented **R**andom **A**rray **G**eneration **E**ngine

## About

Arrays (or simply a list) of numbers is the most commonly used input form for competitive programming questions. Having the ability to generate random arrays of a specific pattern offers the ability to test your algorithm to the limits.

With that idea in mind, presenting GARAGE - a first of its kind (don't quote me on that) graph-based random array generation. Simply key in the graph using the smooth sliders, input the bounds and count values, and generate the array. Plotting the elements of the array would give an exagerrated version of the graph you input.

## Limits

Keeping speed and efficiency in mind, the following are the limitations of the tool

- Lower bound >= -10^9
- Upper bound <= 10^9
- Number of sliders <= Count <= 50000
- 2 <= Number of sliders <= 10
